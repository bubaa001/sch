        "I'm here to help you learn about Francis Maria Libermann School! ðŸ¤–<br><br>I specialize in providing information about our school's admissions, programs, fees, and campus life. Would you like to know more about any of these topics?",
        "That's an interesting question! As the FML School Assistant, I'm focused on helping with school-related inquiries. I can tell you about our academic programs, admission process, or campus facilities. What would you like to explore?",
        "I'm designed to assist with Francis Maria Libermann School information. While I can't help with that specific topic, I'd be happy to discuss our educational programs, fee structure, or student life. What school-related information can I provide?"
    ];
    
    return offTopicResponses[Math.floor(Math.random() * offTopicResponses.length)];
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Response Formatting
