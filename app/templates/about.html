                    <p>
                        Welcome to Francis Maria Libermann School! Francis Maria Libermann School was founded in 1994. Since its establishment, the school has grown steadily, excelling both in academic performance and in the promotion of good morals. The school is located just 5 kilometers from Stone Town, making it accessible to families in and around the urban area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The school offers education from Nursery level up to Secondary level, ensuring a continuous learning journey for children of different ages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Francis Maria Libermann School is a Catholic institution owned by the Catholic Diocese of Zanzibar. It is situated in the Shehia of Tomondo, in the Western District of the Urban West Region. The school officially began in 1996 with the Nursery section, expanded to Primary education in 1998, and later introduced Secondary education in 2007.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From its foundation, the school has welcomed learners from diverse backgrounds. While it is owned and run by the Catholic Church, it is not a place of conversion but a center of knowledge and wisdom. The mission of the school is to provide quality education, nurture discipline, and prepare students to become responsible members of society.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The institution is guided by the Catholic tradition of service and integrity, while remaining open to all faiths. By emphasizing values such as respect, responsibility, and hard work, Francis Maria Libermann School continues to build a strong reputation as a place where both academic success and moral character are developed hand in hand.

                        At its founding in 1998, Francis Maria Libermann School was led by Brother Kiko Baeza, who served as the first headmaster. He was supported by the Nyakato community and a dedicated team of five Tanzanian staff members, who together laid the foundation for the school’s early success. Brother Kiko’s leadership was instrumental in establishing the school’s values-driven approach, emphasizing academic rigor, character formation, and community engagement.
