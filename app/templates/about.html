                    <p>
                        Marist Boys Secondary School was officially opened on January 21, 2013, in Nyakato ward, Ilemela Municipal Council, Mwanza, Tanzania, near the Sayona area (FX88+G7F). Founded by the Marist Brothers, a Catholic religious institute dedicated to education, the school was the realization of a long-held dream to establish a secondary institution in Mwanza-Nyakato. The project was approved by the outgoing Provincial Council, and its opening was celebrated with gratitude, marking a new chapter in the Marist mission in Tanzania.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The school began with 84 students—60 boarders and 24 day scholars—starting with pre-Form One (37 students) and Form One (47 students). It was housed within the premises of the Marist Postulancy in Nyakato, fostering a deep connection to the Marist community. Despite initial challenges, such as limited resources and infrastructure, the school quickly established itself as a beacon of holistic education, guided by the motto <em>"Memento ascendere semper"</em> (Remember always to aim higher).
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6 mb-4">
                    <p>
                        Over the years, Marist Boys Secondary School has grown to offer education from Form 1 to Form 6, welcoming boys from diverse religious backgrounds while maintaining its Catholic ethos. The school has become a cornerstone of the Nyakato community, engaging in activities like educational visits to local companies, such as Sayona Drinking Company, and cultural performances, including singing, which have strengthened its ties with the local community. Parents and students from the pioneering group reported a warm, brotherly welcome, setting a tone of inclusivity and support that continues to define the school’s culture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, the school is recognized for its commitment to academic excellence and character development, with a 14% increase in pass rates and high parental satisfaction (14% satisfied with education, 19% appreciate program variety). As part of the global Marist network, Marist Boys Secondary School continues to uphold the values of St. Marcellin Champagnat, focusing on educating young people, especially those in need, to become responsible and compassionate leaders.

                        At its founding in 2013, Marist Boys Secondary School was led by Brother Kiko Baeza, who served as the first headmaster. He was supported by the Nyakato community and a dedicated team of five Tanzanian staff members, who together laid the foundation for the school’s early success. Brother Kiko’s leadership was instrumental in establishing the school’s values-driven approach, emphasizing academic rigor, character formation, and community engagement.
